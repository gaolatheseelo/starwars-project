# Star Wars Characters
The Star Wars API, or "swapi" (Swah-pee) is the world's first quantified and programmatically-accessible data source for all the data from the Star Wars canon universe! This project uses React, Typescript and Apollo GraphQL API and resolves all People (https://swapi.dev/api/people/), but only the Person's details (name, height, mass, gender, homeworld). The People Query caters for pagination, you will notice the next property in the response. When given a page number, the respective People page will be returned
